> *This was our largest project yet, but the end result is another really useful app that could easily form the starting point for a real conference. Along the way we also learned about custom environment objects, `TabView`, `Result`, `objectWillChange`, image interpolation, context menus, local notifications, Swift package dependencies, `filter()` and `map()`, and so much more – it’s been packed! We’ve explored several of Apple’s other frameworks now – `Core ML`, `MapKit`, `Core Image`, and now `UserNotifications`*
